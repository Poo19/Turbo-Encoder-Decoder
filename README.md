# Turbo-Encoder-Decoder

 This project presents a study on the Design of high performance turbo encoder and iterative turbo decoder using different algorithms. 
 In data transmission, turbo coding helps achieve near Shannon limit performance. MAP, LOG-MAP have been studied and their design 
 considerations have been presented. Turbo coding is an advanced error correction technique widely used in the communications industry.
 Turbo encoders and decoders are key elements in todayâ€™s communication systems to achieve the best possible data reception with the fewest 
 possible errors. The basis of turbo coding is to introduce redundancy in the data to be transmitted through a channel. The redundant 
 data helps to recover original data from the received data. The design problem of generating the turbo code and decoding the code
 iteratively using MAP detectors has been considered. This paper has proposed a design of a TURBO Decoder using MAP Algorithm. 
 Turbo Codes is implemented on DSK TMS320C6424, INTEL atom processor and WiCOMM_T.

 Key Words: Iterative Decoding, Turbo Codes, Redundancy, Forward Error Correction.
